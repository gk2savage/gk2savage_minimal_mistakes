# gk2savage_minimal_mistakes
:triangular_ruler: Jekyll theme for building a personal site, blog, project documentation, or portfolio.

```My own Version of Jekyll minimal_mistakes with few changes and configurations. Feel free to use.```

## install Jekyll

Type in terminal gem install jekyll for installation.
This should work fine when you have all the dependencies installed. If you run into any issue, go to page jekyll install.

##install minimal-mistakes

It takes a little more work to install the theme.
You need to first generate a jekyll folder: jekyll new anyname. Then a folder named anyname is going to be created in your current directory, and it contains all the basic files to make a website.
Then follow the steps described in install minimal-mistakes. It basically involves adding some lines to some files in anyname, or replacing a file with their version on Github, and removing some files.
After you run bundle install, all the dependencies of minimal-mistakes should be successfully installed.

Type ```bundle exec jekyll serve```, and then a template website will be locally hosted at ```localhost:4000/```.
